#### Instructions
Now that you have a fully configured Kali VM we will show you a couple of basics.

1. To shut down your Kali VM issue the following command from a terminal on your host machine (the same machine you issued the `vagrant up` command from)

  ```
  vagrant halt kali
  ```

2. Re-launch your Kali VM by issueing the following command:

  ```
  vagrant up kali
  ```

3. You have completed this lab. You can continue to lab 2 by following the instructions found at
